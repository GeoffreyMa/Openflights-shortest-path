Briefly discussed the possible approaches based on Floyd-Warshall Algorithm and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm during meeting. The objective of this project is to find shortest routes between cities using the given datasets on OpenFlight.org, by implementing Dijkstra's algorithm. Also went through the provided questions for team contract, drafted a detailed contract and had each team member signed. Project goals and team contract were uploaded to GitHub.

# 11/27
Worked individually. 

# 12/4
Files were modified as follow: Makefile was created and adjusted accordingly. Airports, airlines, routes data were added, as well as graph.cpp/.h from lab_ml and the cs225 file. Class Airport was implemented for manipulating the airports' dataset, and AirportsMap is designed to handle the routes and airports using map and graph. Depth-first search algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm were also coded as functions in AirportsMap.cpp/.h.
